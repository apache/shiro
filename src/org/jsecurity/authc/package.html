<p>Core interfaces and exceptions concerning Authentication
    (the act of logging-in).</p>

<p>JSecurity abbreviates the word 'AuthentiCation' as <tt>authc</tt> to distinguish it seperately
    from 'AuthoriZation', abbreviated as <tt>authz</tt>.</p>

<p>The primary item of interest here is the <tt>Authenticator</tt> interface, which acts as the
    primary entry point (facade) to all other other authentication components. Other
    components, interfaces and exceptions are here to support <tt>Authenticator</tt> implementations.</p>
