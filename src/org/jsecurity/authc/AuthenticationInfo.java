/**
 * <code>AuthenticationInfo</code> represents a Subject's (aka user's) stored account information relevant to the
 * authentication/log-in process only.
 * <p/>
 * It is important to understand the differnce between this interface and the
 * {@link AuthenticationToken AuthenticationToken} interface.  <code>AuthenticationInfo</code> implementations
 * represent already-verified and stored account data, whereas an <code>AuthenticationToken</code> represents data
 * submitted for any given login attempt (which may or may not successfully match the verified and stored account
 * <code>AuthenticationInfo</code>).
 * <p/>
 * Because the act of authentication (log-in) is orthoganal to authorization (access control), this interface is
 * intended to represent only the account data needed by JSecurity during an authentication attempt.  JSecurity also
 * has a parallel {@link org.jsecurity.authz.AuthorizationInfo AuthorizationInfo} interface for use during the
 * authorization process that references access control data such as roles and permissions.
 * <p/>
 * But because many if not most {@link org.jsecurity.realm.Realm Realm}s store both sets of data for a Subject, it might be
 * convenient for a <code>Realm</code> implementation to utilize an implementation of the {@link Account Account}
 * interface instead, which is a convenience interface that combines both <code>AuthenticationInfo</code> and
 * <code>AuthorizationInfo</code>.  Whether you choose to implement these two interfaces separately or implement the one
 * <code>Account</code> interface for a given <code>Realm</code> is entirely based on your application's needs.
 *
 * <p><b>Pleae note:</b>  Since JSecurity sometimes logs authentication operations, please ensure your AuthenticationInfo's
 * <code>toString()</code> implementation does <em>not</em> print out account credentials (password, etc), as these might be viewable to
 * someone reading your logs.  This is good practice anyway, and account credentials should rarely (if ever) be printed
 * out for any reason.  If you're using JSecurity's default implementations of this interface, they only ever print the
 * account {@link #getPrincipals() principals}, so you do not need to do anything additional.</p>
