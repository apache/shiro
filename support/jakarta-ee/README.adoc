Shrio-EE feature set

- Able to Annotate CDI and EJB (local & remote) beans with @RequiresXXX
and thus protect them
- Able to use CDI @Session / ViewScoped beans in Shrio-native sessions
- Automatically configure Shiro without anything in web.xml (via Context
listeners)
- Support for automatic no-loss of form data when session expires
- Automatic turn on /off of SSL filter in JSF production/development
mode
- Automatic SSL URLs when proxied via haproxy / Apache
- Mitigate JSF VIewExpiredException automatically (basically never
throws it)
- Works with JSF Client state saving and Server state saving
- Basically, itâ€™s Shiro on steroids when used with Jakarta EE stack as
opposed to changing the way Shiro works by integrating CDI
