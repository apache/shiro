/**
 * A {@code Subject} represents state and security operations for a <em>single</em> application user.
 * These operations include authentication (login/logout), authorization (access control), and
 * session access. It is Shiro's primary mechanism for single-user security functionality.
 * <h3>Acquiring a Subject</h3>
 * To acquire the currently-executing {@code Subject}, application developers will almost always use
 * {@code SecurityUtils}:
 * <pre>
 * {@link SecurityUtils SecurityUtils}.{@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()}</pre>
 * Almost all security operations should be performed with the {@code Subject} returned from this method.
 * <h3>Permission methods</h3>
 * Note that there are many *Permission methods in this interface overloaded to accept String arguments instead of
 * {@link Permission Permission} instances. They are a convenience allowing the caller to use a String representation of
 * a {@link Permission Permission} if desired.  The underlying Authorization subsystem implementations will usually
 * simply convert these String values to {@link Permission Permission} instances and then just call the corresponding
 * type-safe method.  (Shiro's default implementations do String-to-Permission conversion for these methods using
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.PermissionResolver PermissionResolver}s.)
 * <p/>
 * These overloaded *Permission methods forgo type-safety for the benefit of convenience and simplicity,
 * so you should choose which ones to use based on your preferences and needs.

     * <p/>
     * Although the underlying implementation determines exactly how this method functions, most implementations have
     * this method act as the logical equivalent to this code:
     * <pre>
     * {@link #getPrincipal() getPrincipal()} != null && !{@link #isAuthenticated() isAuthenticated()}</pre>
     * <p/>
     * Note as indicated by the above code example, if a {@code Subject} is remembered, they are
     * <em>NOT</em> considered authenticated.  A check against {@link #isAuthenticated() isAuthenticated()} is a more
     * strict check than that reflected by this method.  For example, a check to see if a subject can access financial
     * information should almost always depend on {@link #isAuthenticated() isAuthenticated()} to <em>guarantee</em> a
     * verified identity, and not this method.
     * <p/>
     * Once the subject is authenticated, they are no longer considered only remembered because their identity would
     * have been verified during the current session.
     * <h4>Remembered vs Authenticated</h4>
     * Authentication is the process of <em>proving</em> you are who you say you are.  When a user is only remembered,
     * the remembered identity gives the system an idea who that user probably is, but in reality, has no way of
     * absolutely <em>guaranteeing</em> if the remembered {@code Subject} represents the user currently
     * using the application.
     * <p/>
     * So although many parts of the application can still perform user-specific logic based on the remembered
     * {@link #getPrincipals() principals}, such as customized views, it should never perform highly-sensitive
     * operations until the user has legitimately verified their identity by executing a successful authentication
     * attempt.
     * <p/>
     * We see this paradigm all over the web, and we will use <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> as an
     * example:
     * <p/>
     * When you visit Amazon.com and perform a login and ask it to 'remember me', it will set a cookie with your
     * identity.  If you don't log out and your session expires, and you come back, say the next day, Amazon still knows
     * who you <em>probably</em> are: you still see all of your book and movie recommendations and similar user-specific
     * features since these are based on your (remembered) user id.
     * <p/>
     * BUT, if you try to do something sensitive, such as access your account's billing data, Amazon forces you
     * to do an actual log-in, requiring your username and password.
     * <p/>
     * This is because although amazon.com assumed your identity from 'remember me', it recognized that you were not
     * actually authenticated.  The only way to really guarantee you are who you say you are, and therefore allow you
     * access to sensitive account data, is to force you to perform an actual successful authentication.  You can
     * check this guarantee via the {@link #isAuthenticated() isAuthenticated()} method and not via this method.
     *

     * <b>NOTE</b>: This is provided for framework development support only and should typically never be used by
     * application developers.  {@code Subject} instances should generally be acquired by using
     * <code>SecurityUtils.{@link SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()}</code>
     * <h4>Usage</h4>
     * The simplest usage of this builder is to construct an anonymous, session-less {@code Subject} instance:
     * <pre>
     * Subject subject = new Subject.{@link #Builder() Builder}().{@link #buildSubject() buildSubject()};</pre>
     * The default, no-arg {@code Subject.Builder()} constructor shown above will use the application's
     * currently accessible {@code SecurityManager} via
     * <code>SecurityUtils.{@link SecurityUtils#getSecurityManager() getSecurityManager()}</code>.  You may also
     * specify the exact {@code SecurityManager} instance to be used by the additional
     * <code>Subject.{@link #Builder(org.apache.shiro.mgt.SecurityManager) Builder(securityManager)}</code>
     * constructor if desired.
     * <p/>
     * All other methods may be called before the {@link #buildSubject() buildSubject()} method to
     * provide context on how to construct the {@code Subject} instance.  For example, if you have a session id and
     * want to acquire the {@code Subject} that 'owns' that session (assuming the session exists and is not expired):
     * <pre>
     * Subject subject = new Subject.Builder().sessionId(sessionId).buildSubject();</pre>
     * <p/>
     * Similarly, if you want a {@code Subject} instance reflecting a certain identity:
     * <pre>
     * PrincipalCollection principals = new SimplePrincipalCollection("username", <em>yourRealmName</em>);
     * Subject subject = new Subject.Builder().principals(principals).build();</pre>
     * <p/>
     * <b>Note*</b> that the returned {@code Subject} instance is <b>not</b> automatically bound to the application (thread)
     * for further use.  That is,
     * {@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils SecurityUtils}.{@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()}
     * will not automatically return the same instance as what is returned by the builder.  It is up to the framework
     * developer to bind the built {@code Subject} for continued use if desired.
