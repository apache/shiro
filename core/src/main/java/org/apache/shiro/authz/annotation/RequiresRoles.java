/**
 * Requires the currently executing {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject Subject} to have all of the 
 * specified roles. If they do not have the role(s), the method will not be executed and
 * an {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.AuthorizationException AuthorizationException} is thrown.
 * <p/>
 * For example,
 * <p/>
 * <code>&#64;RequiresRoles("aRoleName");<br/>
 * void someMethod();</code>
 * <p/>
 * means <tt>someMethod()</tt> could only be executed by subjects who have been assigned the
 * 'aRoleName' role.
 *
 * <p><b>*Usage Note*:</b> Be careful using this annotation if your application has a <em>dynamic</em>
 * security model where roles can be added and deleted at runtime.  If your application allowed the
 * annotated role to be deleted during runtime, the method would not be able to
 * be executed by anyone (at least until a new role with the same name was created again).
 *
 * <p>If you require such dynamic functionality, only the
 * {@link RequiresPermissions RequiresPermissions} annotation makes sense - Permission
 * types will not change during runtime for an application since permissions directly correspond to how
 * the application's functionality is programmed (that is, they reflect the application's functionality only, not
 * <em>who</em> is executing the the functionality).
