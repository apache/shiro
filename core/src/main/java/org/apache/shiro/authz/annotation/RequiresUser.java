/**
 * Requires the current Subject to be an application <em>user</em> for the annotated class/instance/method to be
 * accessed or invoked.  This is <em>less</em> restrictive than the {@link RequiresAuthentication RequiresAuthentication}
 * annotation.
 * <p/>
 * Shiro defines a &quot;user&quot; as a Subject that is either
 * &quot;remembered&quot; <b><em>or</em></b> authenticated:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An <b>authenticated</b> user is a Subject that has successfully logged in (proven their identity)
 * <em>during their current session</em>.</li>
 * <li>A <b>remembered</b> user is any Subject that has proven their identity at least once, although not necessarily
 * during their current session, and asked the system to remember them.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * See the {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.RememberMeAuthenticationToken RememberMeAuthenticationToken} JavaDoc for an
 * explanation of why these two states are considered different.
