/**
 * A {@code SecurityManager} executes all security operations for <em>all</em> Subjects (aka users) across a
 * single application.
 * <p/>
 * The interface itself primarily exists as a convenience - it extends the {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.Authenticator},
 * {@link Authorizer}, and {@link SessionManager} interfaces, thereby consolidating
 * these behaviors into a single point of reference.  For most Shiro usages, this simplifies configuration and
 * tends to be a more convenient approach than referencing {@code Authenticator}, {@code Authorizer}, and
 * {@code SessionManager} instances separately;  instead one only needs to interact with a single
 * {@code SecurityManager} instance.
 * <p/>
 * In addition to the above three interfaces, this interface provides a number of methods supporting
 * {@link Subject} behavior. A {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject Subject} executes
 * authentication, authorization, and session operations for a <em>single</em> user, and as such can only be
 * managed by {@code A SecurityManager} which is aware of all three functions.  The three parent interfaces on the
 * other hand do not 'know' about {@code Subject}s to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Usage Note</b>: In actuality the large majority of application programmers won't interact with a SecurityManager
 * very often, if at all.  <em>Most</em> application programmers only care about security operations for the currently
 * executing user, usually attained by calling
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() SecurityUtils.getSubject()}.
 * <p/>
 * Framework developers on the other hand might find working with an actual SecurityManager useful.
 *
 * @see org.apache.shiro.mgt.DefaultSecurityManager
