/**
 * A component that can generate random number/byte values as needed.  Useful in cryptography or security scenarios
 * where random byte arrays are needed, such as for password salts, nonces, initialization vectors and other seeds.
 * <p/>
 * This is essentially the same as a {@link java.security.SecureRandom SecureRandom}, and indeed implementations
 * of this interface will probably all use {@link java.security.SecureRandom SecureRandom} instances, but this
 * interface provides a few additional benefits to end-users:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is an interface rather than the JDK's {@code SecureRandom} concrete implementation.  Implementation details
 * can be customized as necessary based on the application's needs</li>
 * <li>Default per-instance behavior can be customized on implementations, typically via JavaBeans mutators.</li>
 * <li>Perhaps most important for Shiro end-users, tt can more easily be used as a source of cryptographic seed data,
 * and the data returned is already in a more convenient {@link ByteSource ByteSource} format in case that data needs
 * to be {@link org.apache.shiro.util.ByteSource#toHex() hex} or
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.util.ByteSource#toBase64() base64}-encoded.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For example, consider the following example generating password salts for new user accounts:
 * <pre>
 * RandomNumberGenerator saltGenerator = new {@link org.apache.shiro.crypto.SecureRandomNumberGenerator SecureRandomNumberGenerator}();
 * User user = new User();
 * user.setPasswordSalt(saltGenerator.nextBytes().toBase64());
 * userDAO.save(user);
 * </pre>
