/**
 * A filter that translates an HTTP Request's Method (e.g. GET, POST, etc.)
 * into an corresponding action (verb) and uses that verb to construct a permission that will be checked to determine
 * access.
 * <p/>
 * This Filter is primarily provided to support REST environments where the type (Method)
 * of request translates to an action being performed on one or more resources.  This paradigm works well with Shiro's
 * concepts of using permissions for access control and can be leveraged to easily perform permission checks.
 * <p/>
 * This filter functions as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The incoming HTTP request's Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) is discovered.</li>
 * <li>The Method is translated into a more 'application friendly' verb, such as 'create', edit', 'delete', etc.</li>
 * <li>The verb is appended to any configured permissions for the
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.web.filter.PathMatchingFilter currently matching path}.</li>
 * <li>If the current {@code Subject} {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject#isPermitted(String) isPermitted} to
 * perform the resolved action, the request is allowed to continue.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * For example, if the following filter chain was defined, where 'rest' was the name given to a filter instance of
 * this class:
 * <pre>
 * /user/** = rest[user]</pre>
 * Then an HTTP {@code GET} request to {@code /user/1234} would translate to the constructed permission
 * {@code user:read} (GET is mapped to the 'read' action) and execute the permission check
 * <code>Subject.isPermitted(&quot;user:read&quot;)</code> in order to allow the request to continue.
 * <p/>
 * Similarly, an HTTP {@code POST} to {@code /user} would translate to the constructed permission
 * {@code user:create} (POST is mapped to the 'create' action) and execute the permission check
 * <code>Subject.isPermitted(&quot;user:create&quot;)</code> in order to allow the request to continue.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Method To Verb Mapping</h3>
 * The following table represents the default HTTP Method-to-action verb mapping:
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>HTTP Method</th><th>Mapped Action</th><th>Example Permission</th><th>Runtime Check</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>head</td><td>read</td><td>perm1</td><td>perm1:read</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>get</td><td>read</td><td>perm2</td><td>perm2:read</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>put</td><td>update</td><td>perm3</td><td>perm3:update</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>post</td><td>create</td><td>perm4</td><td>perm4:create</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>mkcol</td><td>create</td><td>perm5</td><td>perm5:create</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>options</td><td>read</td><td>perm6</td><td>perm6:read</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>trace</td><td>read</td><td>perm7</td><td>perm7:read</td></tr>
 * </table>
