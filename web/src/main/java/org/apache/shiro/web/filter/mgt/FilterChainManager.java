    /**
     * Creates a filter chain for the given {@code chainName} with the specified {@code chainDefinition}
     * String.
     * <h3>Conventional Use</h3>
     * Because the {@code FilterChainManager} interface does not impose any restrictions on filter chain names,
     * (it expects only Strings), a convenient convention is to make the chain name an actual URL path expression
     * (such as an {@link org.apache.shiro.lang.util.AntPathMatcher Ant path expression}).  For example:
     * <p/>
     * <code>createChain(<b><em>path_expression</em></b>, <em>path_specific_filter_chain_definition</em>);</code>
     * This convention can be used by a {@link FilterChainResolver} to inspect request URL paths
     * against the chain name (path) and, if a match is found, return the corresponding chain for runtime filtering.
     * <h3>Chain Definition Format</h3>
     * The {@code chainDefinition} method argument is expected to conform to the following format:
     * <pre>
     * filter1[optional_config1], filter2[optional_config2], ..., filterN[optional_configN]</pre>
     * where
     * <ol>
     * <li>{@code filterN} is the name of a filter previously
     * {@link #addFilter(String, javax.servlet.Filter) registered} with the manager, and</li>
     * <li>{@code [optional_configN]} is an optional bracketed string that has meaning for that particular filter for
     * <em>this particular chain</em></li>
     * </ol>
     * If the filter does not need specific config for that chain name/URL path,
     * you may discard the brackets - that is, {@code filterN[]} just becomes {@code filterN}.
     * <p/>
     * And because this method does create a chain, remember that order matters!  The comma-delimited filter tokens in
     * the {@code chainDefinition} specify the chain's execution order.
     * <h3>Examples</h3>
     * <pre>/account/** = authcBasic</pre>
     * This example says &quot;Create a filter named '{@code /account/**}' consisting of only the '{@code authcBasic}'
     * filter&quot;.  Also because the {@code authcBasic} filter does not need any path-specific
     * config, it doesn't have any config brackets {@code []}.
     * <p/>
     * <pre>/remoting/** = authcBasic, roles[b2bClient], perms[&quot;remote:invoke:wan,lan&quot;]</pre>
     * This example by contrast uses the 'roles' and 'perms' filters which <em>do</em> use bracket notation.  This
     * definition says:
     * <p/>
     * Construct a filter chain named '{@code /remoting/**}' which
     * <ol>
     * <li>ensures the user is first authenticated ({@code authcBasic}) then</li>
     * <li>ensures that user has the {@code b2bClient} role, and then finally</li>
     * <li>ensures that they have the {@code remote:invoke:lan,wan} permission.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p/>
     * <b>Note</b>: because elements within brackets [ ] can be comma-delimited themselves, you must quote the
     * internal bracket definition if commas are needed (the above example has 'lan,wan').  If we didn't do that, the
     * parser would interpret the chain definition as four tokens:
     * <ol>
     * <li>authcBasic</li>
     * <li>roles[b2bclient]</li>
     * <li>perms[remote:invoke:lan</li>
     * <li>wan]</li>
     * </ol>
     * which is obviously incorrect.  So remember to use quotes if your internal bracket definitions need to use commas.
     *
