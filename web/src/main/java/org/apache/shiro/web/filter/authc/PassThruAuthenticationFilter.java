/**
 * An authentication filter that redirects the user to the login page when they are trying to access
 * a protected resource.  However, if the user is trying to access the login page, the filter lets
 * the request pass through to the application code.
 * <p/>
 * The difference between this filter and the {@link FormAuthenticationFilter FormAuthenticationFilter} is that
 * on a login submission (by default an HTTP POST to the login URL), the <code>FormAuthenticationFilter</code> filter
 * attempts to automatically authenticate the user by passing the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>
 * request parameter values to
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject#login(org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken) Subject.login(usernamePasswordToken)}
 * directly.
 * <p/>
 * Conversely, this controller always passes all requests to the {@link #setLoginUrl loginUrl} through, both GETs and
 * POSTs.  This is useful in cases where the developer wants to write their own login behavior, which should include a
 * call to {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject#login(org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken) Subject.login(AuthenticationToken)}
 * at some point.  For example,  if the developer has their own custom MVC login controller or validator,
 * this <code>PassThruAuthenticationFilter</code> may be appropriate.
