TODO
====

* Make this project work with jetty + weld (or some other simple CDI container)
* remove the need for faces in this example (this still have references to the PAX example)
* Update all samples to use newer eclipse jetty (this project will require it), so everything should be constant.

**NOTE:** this Example has been hacked up a bit while attempting to make work against jetty. It does NOT currently work.
